バンドが解散して長年の歳月が流れてもなお、多くのロックファンから強い支持を集めてます。
エルレの復活が確定すると、そのチケットの倍率はとんでもないことに・・・。当選発表翌日に数十万単位のチケットが転売サイトで取引されるほどに、エルレの人気は凄まじいです。
現在、主に活動されているモノアイズでも、その人気は不動。
一つの時代を築いたロックスターとして、
多くの邦楽ロックファンから尊敬の眼差しを集められてますが、
プライベートな部分は謎が多いです。
最近は多くの若いロックミュージシャンが風紀的なネタで世間を盛り上げてますし、
過去にはグレイやミスチル、B’zなどのメジャーバンドのメンバーも、女性関係で大きなネタを発してます。
エルレの細身さんにだって、きっと濃い女性ネタはある！と思ってしまう部分はありますが、
実際には、ノースキャンダルで真っ白なのです。
細美武士は結婚してるのか？ ２０１８年時点で、細美さんが結婚してる噂は多数ありますが、
実際にはどこにも公表されておらず、
さらにはエルレの復活やモノアイズの濃厚な対バンツアーなど、
激務なスケジュールを考えると、現実的にあり得ません。
年齢的にも支えてくれる女性がいて欲しいと願う方もいると思いますが、
変な女性に騙されて、変な色がつくのは怖いですね。。
仮に結婚したとしたら、
自身の媒体から直接ファンに告げるか、
もしくはライブのMCの中でポロっと言うと思います。
個人的にはミュージシャンとか、
芸術的な才能のある女性と結婚して、
バンド活動に強い恩恵が来て欲しいなと思います。
女優やガールズバンドなど、
細美さんに憧れてる美人著名人はたくさんいるので、
正直、選び放題な気もするのですが・・・。
女性遊びがどれほどのものなのかは分かりませんね。。
人間的にも素晴らしい方なので、
事故ってデキ婚する可能性も低いですね。
現在、５０歳に近づいてる細身さんですが、生涯独身いくつもりなのかと心配にもなります。
結婚願望に対する言及はあまり聞かないので、しばらくファンのために時間を捧げるつもりなのかと思われます。
過去に高瀬友規奈が彼女と噂 過去に細美は「高瀬友規奈」という女優と噂になりました。
２０世紀少年などに出演していた女性さんですが、
世間一般的に、名前はあまり知られてませんね・・・・。
生年月日 ：1987年7月31日（30歳）
出生地： 東京都
身長 ：164 cm
血液型：A型
職業 ：女優
ジャンル： 映画、テレビドラマ、舞台
事務所：JOY MAKER
２０１６年頃の噂でしたが、
彼女と細美さんお忍びでフジロックに来ていたなど目撃談はあります。
現在の高瀬さんは俳優の小野健斗さんと交際しているので、
その噂が当初は本当だったとしても、すでに破局はしてることになります。
珍しい著名人との熱愛ネタということで、
ファンの記憶には強く残っていますが、
フジで同伴してたこと以外に決定的な証拠がないので、
そこまで真剣に受け取る気にはなりませんよね。
アイドルではなくロックスターなのです。
西野ｶﾅとの熱愛はｶﾞｾ これは今のネット社会だからこその現象ですが、
「細美武士」の名前を打ち込むと、
「西野カナ」の名前が出てくるのです。
一瞬、熱愛疑惑がある？もしくは過去にあった？と誤解されますが、
実際には何もありません。
いったい、なぜこのような現象が起きるのか・・・。
もしかしたら、細美武士さん側、もしくは西野カナさん側が、</description></item><item><title>Fat Joe Reveals How 50 Cent Beef Cost Him $20M</title><link>/fat-joe-50-cent-beef-20-million-loss.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/fat-joe-50-cent-beef-20-million-loss.html</guid><description>Fat Joe’s beef with 50 Cent in the mid 2000s may have coincided with his commercial peak as an artist, but the feud also came at a hefty cost.
