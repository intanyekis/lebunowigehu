The loving wife of Actor Larry Hagman, she was known as an amazing hostess and mainstay of the family. Born in May, 1928 in Eskilstuna, Sweden, she was the eldest of four sisters. Her father, who had a car dealership in Sweden, told his daughter to "reach for the stars in order to get to the treetops" and Maj followed his advice moving to London and becoming an accomplished dress designer. In London she met the love of her life, a young serviceman named Larry Hagman, who had recently performed in the cast of the Broadway import musical "South Pacific," with his mother, the acclaimed New York musical theater star Mary Martin. Mag moved to New York City as a military bride and supported her husband Larry by designing and sewing costumes for night club singers while Larry worked in the New York theater. When Larry landed a starring role in the early 1960s on Hollywood's "I Dream of Jeannie," Mag turned her considerable talents to supporting Larry's ascending career while continuing to design clothes, build extraordinary homes and even custom-design Jacuzzis. Mag later shared in the joys and successes of Larry Hagman's success as "JR Ewing" on the popular hit television series "Dallas" that ran from the late 1970s through the 1980s. The couple supported philanthropic causes from the Dallas and Ojai Symphonies to organ donations and solar energy. The couple traveled the world together over five and a half decades of their marriage until Larry passed away in 2012. In the end, she surpassed the treetops and touched the stars.
