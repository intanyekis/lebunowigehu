The time constraints of having a successful career easily conflict with the demanding needs of taking care of a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kids of famous parents are a paparazzi goldmine. Wherever they go, they are being photographed starting from the day of their birth. Some photos of superstar infants, when they are first born, are worth up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for the tabloid press. Paparazzi photographers will do almost anything to get these photos.</p><p>When the kids go out in public with their famous parents, the attention continues. Moreover, if the famous parents are wealthy, they will have the financial resources to spoil their kids terribly.</p><p>In spite of all of these pressures, some celebrity moms and their husbands do their best to keep their kids grounded and help them live as “normal” of a life as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie>Angelina Jolie</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a> is a great mom. When she goes on trips to foreign countries in her role as a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador, she frequently invites her children to go with her. They go along because they want to go. Recently, she took her two daughters Zahara and Shiloh to visit a refugee camp in Jordan that has many thousands of Syrian refugees. Her daughters played with some of the children and got to see their living conditions firsthand.</p><p>Jolie champions women’s and girl’s rights and especially is involved in helping educational programs for children. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">International Business Times</a> says that she is concerned about the challenges that the younger generation faces in the age of social media. She does not let her six children be active on social media and limits their access to the Internet. Instead of relishing her time on the red carpet as a Hollywood superstar, her favorite things to do are to take her kids shopping at the mall and to go out for pizza. It is clear from the many photos captured by the paparazzi that her children adore her, especially when they do “normal” things together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jolie was recently named by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 YouGov survey</a> as the most respected female in the world for the third year in a row. This annual survey asked 35,000 people in 35 countries who they admire the most. Being a great mom is a big part of why she is so admired.</p><h2 id=jennifer-garner>Jennifer Garner</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> has three children from her marriage to her now ex-husband <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a>. They are Samuel, Seraphina, and Violet. She lives with the kids on a farm near the Los Angeles area. Jennifer says her mother taught her about healthy eating and she does the same with her children. They raise most of the food that they eat, which includes plenty of fruits and vegetables.</p><p>When Jennifer was pregnant with her first daughter, she opened a jar of baby food and was disgusted by it. That is when she decided that making food for her kids to eat using fresh things was the way to go. None of that store-bought overly-processed baby food was going to be fed to her kids.

In 2015, she started dating Wilson after she broke up with Future. She had a son with Future that was born in 2014. Wilson got engaged to Ciara in 2016 and they were married in July of that year. In April 2017, they had a baby girl. So this means they have two children to bring up together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> reports that the couple gave their baby girl a special name, Sienna Princess Wilson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Does this mean that the parents plan to spoil their girl child like a princess? Probably so; however, they have been doing a pretty good job of keeping their children grounded in reality of what it is like to be a “normal” kid. On the other hand, when Ciara and Russell Wilson were married, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> reported that her son was wearing a Giorgio Armani suit that upstaged his mother’s Robert Cavalli wedding dress.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis>Mila Kunis</h2><p><a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> is happily married to <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>.

In spite of this good parenting, Kunis told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US magazine</a> her boy is a “sloth.” A sloth is a very slow-moving animal. A possible conclusion is that the parenting style of not spoiling kids does not exactly motivate them either. Kunis is comfortable being a <a href=#>stay-at-home mom</a> so she has plenty of time to work on this problem.</p><p>The moral of this parenting style is that the kids of the Kunis/Kutcher family can forget about going to their parents and asking for a new Ferrari on their 16th birthday. That is never going to happen. If they ever want to achieve anything in life; they need to get off their lazy asses and do something. That seems fair.</p><h2 id=janet-jackson>Janet Jackson</h2><p><a href=#>Janet Jackson</a> is a wonderful woman; however, she has experienced so many up and downs that the emotional roller-coaster of her life must be very exhausting.

This type of depression is caused by biological and chemical imbalances plus hormonal effects in the mother’s body. It feels really terrible because having a new child is supposed to be a happy experience. This also makes the mother feel guilty, which only increases the feeling of despair.
